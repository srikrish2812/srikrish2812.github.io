Django is a Python web framework that allows you to build web applications quickly and easily. It is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a robust set of tools for building web applications.

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

This is still a work in progress.
