I am Abhay Nandiraju, a self-driven student interested in Computer Vision, NLP and Deep Learning. I will be starting my PhD in Intelligent Systems in Fall-2025 at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by [Dr Shandong Wu](https://www.aimi.pitt.edu/people/ant-26). I did my MS in Information Science: Machine Learning degree at the University of Arizona, during which I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Deep Target NLP Research group, led by [Dr Gondy Leroy](https://eller.arizona.edu/people/gondy-leroy). Prior to this, I did my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Tirupati. During my bachelorâ€™s, I worked in the Visual Information and Signal Analysis Lab(ViSAL) in the field of small object detection, and was fortunate to be advised by [Dr Rama Krishna Sai Gorthi](https://ee.iittp.ac.in/Faculty_Rkg.html).
