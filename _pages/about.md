Hi! I am Abhay, PhD student in the Intelligent Systems program at the University of Pittsburgh working on Multimodal Learning and Foundation Models, fortunate to be advised by [Dr Shandong Wu](https://www.aimi.pitt.edu/people/ant-26). I am also interested in adapting RL techniques in my work and learning the skill of decomposing complex problems into smaller sub-problems. In addition to this, I like understanding deep learning architectures from both theoretical foundations and practical implementations.

Previously, I did my MS in Information Science: Machine Learning at the University of Arizona, during which I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Deep Target NLP Research group, led by [Dr Gondy Leroy](https://eller.arizona.edu/people/gondy-leroy). Prior to this, I did my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Tirupati. During this time, I learnt about Control Theory, Machine Learning, Image Processing, Statistical Signal Processing, and Deep Learning architectures for Computer Vision. I did bachelor's thesis on *Efficient Data Augmentation methods for Drone Detection* in the Visual Information and Signal Analysis Lab(ViSAL) under the invaluable guidance of [Dr Rama Krishna Sai Gorthi](https://ee.iittp.ac.in/Faculty_Rkg.html).
